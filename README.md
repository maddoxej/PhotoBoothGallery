Photo Booth Gallery
=================

Started with the Microsoft sample app Infinite Image Scroll MVC

This shows images in a web page made to look like some photo strips. 
The root of the site is the same as /home/index. It shows the 12 most recent images in 3 colums of 4 images each. 
When one, two or three images are added, they are ignored. It is not until a full page of 4 images are added that a new strip appears on the site. 

/home/index/1 displays the second page with older images. However there are no paging links. 
/home/print displays a page 150% larger which is a good size for a printer. The home/index page is intentionally small to fit on the screen of the WII Internet Channel which uses the Opera Browser. 4 images 80px tall stacked seem to fit. Width is 480.
